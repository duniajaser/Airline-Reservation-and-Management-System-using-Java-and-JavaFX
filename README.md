# Starlight: Airline Reservation and Management System

## Project Overview

Starlight is designed to revolutionize the way airlines and passengers interact, streamlining the reservation and management process with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency. This system brings a new level of ease to air travel, offering comprehensive tools for passengers and airline staff alike.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Booking Portal**: An intuitive interface for hassle-free flight searching, booking, and management for passengers.
- **Efficient Airline Management**: Centralized scheduling and management tools tailored for airline operations, ensuring smooth workflows.
- **Secure Payment Integration**: A reliable and secure system for processing payments, supporting multiple payment methods.
- **Feedback System**: Collect valuable insights directly from users to continually enhance the travel experience.

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaFX
- **Backend**: MySQL
- **Platform**: Windows 10

## Entities and Relationships

Our system models the airline reservation and management domain through the following entities and their attributes:

- **Airlines**: Include attributes like Airline ID, Name, Capacity, and Model.
- **Flights**: Defined by Flight ID, Departure City, Destination City, Departure Time, and Arrival Time.
- **Passengers**: Captured with attributes such as Passenger ID, Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Email, and Address.
- **Bookings**, **Feedbacks**, and **Payment Transactions** further detail the interactions within the system.

Each entity and its relationship are meticulously designed to encapsulate the business logic of airline operations, detailed in the projectâ€™s Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
