# Starlight: Airline Reservation and Management System

Starlight is designed to revolutionize the way airlines and passengers interact, streamlining the reservation and management process with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency. This system brings a new level of ease to air travel, offering comprehensive tools for passengers and airline staff alike.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Booking Portal**: An intuitive interface for hassle-free flight searching, booking, and management for passengers.
- **Efficient Airline Management**: Centralized scheduling and management tools tailored for airline operations, ensuring smooth workflows.
- **Secure Payment Integration**: A reliable and secure system for processing payments, supporting multiple payment methods.
- **Feedback System**: Collect valuable insights directly from users to continually enhance the travel experience.

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaFX
- **Backend**: MySQL
- **Platform**: Windows 10

## Entities and Relationships

Our system models the airline reservation and management domain through the following entities and their attributes:

- **Airlines**: Include attributes like Airline ID, Name, Capacity, and Model.
- **Flights**: Defined by Flight ID, Departure City, Destination City, Departure Time, and Arrival Time.
- **Passengers**: Captured with attributes such as Passenger ID, Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Email, and Address.
- **Bookings**, **Feedbacks**, and **Payment Transactions** further detail the interactions within the system.

Each entity and its relationship are meticulously designed to encapsulate the business logic of airline operations, detailed in the projectâ€™s Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
